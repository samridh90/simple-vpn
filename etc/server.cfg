# This is the shared-secret, which is the only mandatory configuration
# setting for the server.
#
# Clients will send their own shared-secret at the time they connect,
# and if this secret does not match the one configured on the server their
# connection will be dropped.
#
# Ideally this key will be long and complex.

## Optional settings now follow
##


##
## Change the name of our device
##
#
# device = svpn
#


##
## Change the subnet from which we allocate IPs
##
#
# subnet = 10.137.248.0/24 OR fde4:8dba:82e1:fefe::/64
#


##
## Setup static-ips for particular clients, each client sends a name when
## connecting, and that name can be overridden via the client-configuration
## file.
##
## NOTE: These IPs must be within the subnet the server is using.
##
#
# host_deagol = 10.137.248.10
#
# host_frodo  = 10.137.248.20
#


##
## When a new client connects to the VPN server we can run a command, with
## details of that connection, stored in environmental variables:
##
##  $INTERNAL_IP -  e.g 10.0.0.2.
##  $EXTERNAL_IP -  e.g 100.200.300.200
##  $NAME        -  e.g. gold
##
#
# up = /etc/simple-vpn/blah.sh
